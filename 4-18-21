going to the snapping line- Pub
__________________________________________
wake up early, do our moring tasks and meet back up at around noon
we are going to address the council to let them know about the goings about
going back to the boat to see long john and silver.
  they are tied up. (note said it's a pirates life for me able, fable, table, and sable) they also took the dhingy
Stavros is going to the cargo hold.

salmar -

Zinfir remembers alexander Fireborn - the crow would be willing to buy any goods found

Sue, is staying with the boat.
The council doors are open but no one is there  meeting. A secratary is there and everyone is meeting tomorrow. We can try and meet with Olin () and call a earlier meeting.
Going to the Olin home to try and get a council meeting today.

The olin Compound - won't be able to get everyone to the meeting but will try to get everyone who is available meeting at 3pm

Eklius found a door that was left ajar (in the first mates cabin). There is another hidden storage area in the room next to the first mates room. Both rooms are empty.

 Silver is there the other is not. Drinking claw wine. Telling a wild story to Hanah. Zinfir and Sue are sitting back listening to Silver tell his story to Hanah. We go in and help with the story. Keep him drinking so he's sleeping for the council meeting. Zinfir gets some seafood to share with everyone.

Eklius comes and starts eating at the table. Silver is still drinking.

3 people missing at the council meeting (missing: Eliander Fireborn, and 2 others). Solmar is not bothered at all by this news, possibly pleased ( his servant scarab wavechaser does not look happy)
The ship has goods the crown would like to buy. Talk to fireborn head of the guard.

Council members - most are human, one halfling.
The halfling becomes more alert after hearing about the lizard folk.
Not sure what to do next. Movement and working with humans worries the council.

Find primewater to see if he wants to buy any of the goods.

At primewater's residence:
  (felisia) female gnome greets us (in an apron), 10 eletin ingots (1 ingot = 100 gp), 500 gd for the ingots.
