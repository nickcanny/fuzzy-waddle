------------------------------------------------------------
dirty 20, I understand that the signaling system is very simple, incoming-arrived from house-it is safe -or- not safe to dock here, no code-probaly noone is there and that they will stay in the area for a few days and wait for someone to be availble.
-- I learn that I am surrounded by idiots---
Long john is set up in a room (facing the sea) to signal the ship.
Trying to come up with a plan to bamboozle them. 
  -Long john is dumb as shit - big ships don't fit in to small caves......
    wait for a landing party or taking them on the boat.
    **we are still level 2) ****
    we are going to try and hide in barrels. Zinfir is out of a barrel and move us on the ship.
the ship was signaled.
  we waited for an hour and nothing, we go towards the boat that was singaled 
  signaled silver and pretty sure it was only to him.
  not sure what silver is upto, possibly coming towards us.
  
  (sue and stavros) are trying to climb abord the ship sneakily and Zinfir and Eklius are going to try and get on with the barrels. 
  Eklius does not get any vibes (fay, undead or fiendish).
  
  the ship people are not amused and are tired of Zinfir's shit.
    they are going to tattle on us 
    
+++FIGHT....
Stavros is on the boat, I am not.
fight is not going well.
